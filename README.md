**PLEASE NOTE**

This project is not related to IONOS / 1&1; the class was created for private use and just for specific use cases. Therefore its possible that...
- not all API functions are supported yet (but feel free to add them! ðŸ˜‰)
- the functions will not work as intended (so use that code on your own risk)
